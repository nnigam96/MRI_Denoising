### Capstone Course Project
### By: Cameron Craig, Justin Hiemstra

This repository contains the codebase for our capstone course project. Some of the files here are python notebooks which were used to interactively explore data and develop various components of the project. The core code for training the supervised U-Net exists as multiple .py files.

### Usage:

Please run the notebook 'run_project_demo.ipynb' on Google Colab. You can access it  [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ojJ0Y0Ct1zwjKPgS643_Fxtlq-aTWUx7?usp=sharing).

This notebook contains an easy-to-use and step-by-step guide through the core functions of the codebase. It is intended to be run inside of Google Colab with a GPU runtime. It may work outside of colab on your local machine if your python environment is similar to the stock colab environment.
